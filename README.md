- Hi, I’m @quk2021
    - The "quk" stands for "quest knowledge". 
    - As for "2021", it is related to "scala 3", which was released on 2021. 
        - I believe scala, particularly "scala 3", plays a key role in "quest knowledge".
            - The reason: scala is critical for Big-data, and in turn for AI.    
                - And, by the way :-) I’m interested in A, B, and C: AI, Big-data, and Cloud-computing.
