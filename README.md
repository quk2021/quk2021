# Hi, I’m quk2021
- The "quk" stands for "quest knowledge". 
- As for "2021", it is related to "scala 3", which was released on 2021. 
    - I believe scala, particularly "scala 3", plays a key role in "quest knowledge".
        - The reason: scala is critical for Big-data, and in turn for AI.    
            - And, by the way :-) I’m interested in A, B, and C: AI, Big-data, and Cloud-computing.
